= Getting started

{ProductName} is a multi-tenant, software as a service (SaaS) based continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service with an emphasis on secure supply chain features.

== Signing up
Let’s get you signed up!

. Go to https://console.redhat.com/beta/hac/application-pipeline[{ProductName}]. 
. Click *Join waitlist*. 

== Creating your first application
We include ready-to-use bundled code samples that you can import into our service. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to fork a sample repository and create your first application. 

=== Naming your application
Every great app needs a name – add yours! 

. Select *Create an application*. 
. Name your application.

=== Choosing a bundled sample

Scroll to the section *Select a sample* and choose one of the following options: 

* Node.js
* Quarkus
* Spring Boot
* Python 
* Go

Decided on a favorite sample? Great! Now let’s fork the code to your repo in the next section. By the way, we call this code a _component_. 

=== Forking a sample repository

==== Why should you fork a sample?

There are many perks to forking one of our samples, this list shows a few:

* Pipeline customization
* Automated builds for new commits with GitHub webhook integration
* Pull request testing
* Rebuilding dependencies from source
* Scanning your build for vulnerabilities, viruses, and other checks

==== How to fork a sample

To fork the sample, complete the following steps:

. In the sample that you chose, click *Git repository*. This link takes you to GitHub.
. Now that you’re in GitHub, click *Fork*.
. Copy the URL of this new forked repository. We'll use this URL in the next section! 

[NOTE]
====
Right now we support GitHub, but come back soon for other Git providers! 
====

=== Importing the code from your forked repository

. Return to the app and scroll up to *Bring in your own code*. 
. In *Git repo URL*, paste the URL that you copied in the previous section.
. Click *Import code*.

=== Reviewing and configuring
We now scan your Git repository for source code and detect your runtime and other configuration settings for you to review. You have the option to use our default build pipeline or to customize the pipeline. 

For now, leave the toggle set to *Default build pipeline*.

== Congrats!

Now, scroll to the end of the page and click *Create application*. We build an image from the source code of this sample. 

Congrats! You're done with the first steps! 

== Next steps

=== Adding more components 

Because your application can run on one or more components, you might want to add more. 

The additional source code that you add can either be from the same repository that you used when you created your application, _or_ a different Git repository. Remember, we call source code _components_.

In the *Overview* tab, select *Add component*:

image::Add_more_components.png[Overview tab that shows how you can add additional components to your application. The Overview button is on the bottom left and has a red arrow next to it.]

=== Customizing your build pipeline

To add automation, you can upgrade your default build pipelines to custom build pipelines. 

Custom build pipelines are pipelines as code, set on your component's repository. With custom build pipelines, pull requests and commits to your main branch automatically rebuild. 

By customizing your build pipeline, you can change the tasks that are included, control when those tasks update to newer versions, and accept any changes to the pipeline when you're ready for them.

To get started, click *Manage build pipelines* from the *Overview* page.

=== Viewing your activity 
You can view your latest commits, as well as your pipeline runs. 

==== Viewing your latest commits

Since you forked your repo, you have permissions to commit to the Git repo. We like to focus on commits, rather than pipelines, so that it’s easy to correlate a developer's work with what’s going on in the system. 

To view your recent commits, go to the *Activity* tab and click *Latest commits*. 

==== Viewing your pipeline runs

Didn’t fork your repo? Fret not! You can also view your activity by pipeline runs. A pipeline run is a collection of TaskRuns that are arranged in a specific order of execution. 

To view your pipeline runs, go to the *Activity* tab and click *Pipeline runs*. 

The following image shows the *Pipeline run details*. 

image::Pipeline-runs.png[View of an application's pipeline runs. Multiple tasks are depicted in a tree flow and the user can click on a task to view more details.]

From the previous view, you can see tasks that you can run based on the pipeline definition while the image is being inspected. You can also click an individual task to see its details. 

=== Viewing your application route

You can find each component’s route in the *Components* tab, next to each component’s details.

=== Managing compliance with Enterprise Contract 
The Enterprise Contract (EC) is an artifact verifier and customizable policy checker. You can use EC to keep your software supply chain secure and to ensure that container images comply with your organization’s policies.

=== Deploying your app 
Check the status of your application in *Environments*. You can view information about your environment such as its type, strategy, and deployment status:

image::Environments.png[The Environments tab shows the type of your environment, its deployment strategy, the cluster type, the application status, the last deploy, and the applications deployed. In this example, the type is Default, the strategy is Automatic, the cluster type is OpenShift, the Application status is Missing, the Last deploy is -, and there are 3 applications deployed.]

An environment is a set of compute resources that you can use to develop, test, and stage your applications. There is a development environment included for you so that you can explore {ProductName}.

=== Examining your SBOM

A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a list of all the software libraries that a component uses. You can run 'cosign' in your command line interface (CLI) to inspect the image SBOM.
