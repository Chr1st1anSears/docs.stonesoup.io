= Prefetching the package manager dependencies for the hermetic build

In {ProductName}, hermetic builds are achieved by restricting network access to the build. Consequently, builds using supported languages may fail if they cannot retrieve dependencies from repositories. To address this, {ProductName} uses Cachi2 to prefetch the package manager dependencies for the supported-languages. Cachi2 makes it easier for package managers to prefetch dependencies. It also helps generate a manifest of all dependencies included in your builds, ensuring transparency and maintainability.

== Enabling prefetch builds for `gomod`

.Prerequisites
* You have an link:https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_upgrade_build_pipeline/[upgraded build pipeline].

* You have a `go.mod` file in your repository that lists all the dependencies.

.Procedures
To create a hermetic build for a component, complete the following steps:

. Go to the `.tekton` directory in the repository of your component and locate the *.yaml* files related to the *pull-request* and *push* processes.

. Configure the hermetic pipeline by adding the following hermetic pipeline parameters in both the *.yaml* files:

+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    params:
        -   ...
        -   name: prefetch-input
            value: '{"type": "gomod", "path": "."}' <1>
----
<1> The `prefetch-input` parameter specifies the path to the directory that has the lockfile and the package metadata files. In the above example, the `.` indicates that the package manager lock file is located in the root of the repository. Additionally, if you have multiple directories, you can provide the path to those directories in the JSON array format. For example, `[{"path": ".", "type": "gomod"}, {"path": "subpath/to/the/other/directory", "type": "gomod"}]`.

+
NOTE: When adding the parameters mentioned above, you can safely ignore the default values for the link:https://github.com/burrsutter/partner-catalog-stage/blob/e2ebb05ba8b4e842010710898d555ed3ba687329/.tekton/partner-catalog-stage-wgxd-pull-request.yaml#L90[`pipelineSpec.params`] in the *.yaml* files.

. Create a pull request (PR) by committing your changes to the repository of the component.

. Review and merge the PR.

== Enabling prefetch builds for `pip`
Cachi2 supports pip by parsing of `pip` requirements files, including but not limited to, *requirements.txt* files placed in the root of your repository. By generically parsing `pip` requirements files, Cachi2 downloads the specified dependencies.

IMPORTANT: The requirements file can have a different name, as you can use multiple files to provide the dependencies. These requirements files function as lock files, encompassing all the transitive dependencies. You must actively pin each transitive dependency listed in the requirements file to a specific version.

.Prerequisites
* You have an link:https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_upgrade_build_pipeline/[upgraded build pipeline].

* You have an environment that closely matches the environment in the container build, meaning it has the same operating system and the same python $major.$minor version.

* You have installed the link:https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools[pip-tools] package.

.Procedures
To create a hermetic build for a component, complete the following steps:

. Download the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerbuildsystem/cachito/master/bin/pip_find_builddeps.py[pip_find_builddeps.py] script directly from GitHub.

+
NOTE: This script has no runtime dependency other than `pip`.

. Add the script that you downloaded in a directory that is already included in your $PATH. For example, you can use the `~/bin` directory in your home folder. Ensure that it exists or create it if needed. To add it to the $PATH permanently, you can modify the shell configuration file (for example, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`)  and restart the terminal after appending the following line:

+
[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
----
. Open the terminal and go to the directory where you placed the `pip_find_builddeps.py` script and run the following command to make it executable:

+
[source,bash]
----
chmod +x pip_find_builddeps.py
----

. Go to your component's source code.

. Review the root of your repository for a metadata file, for example, *pyproject.toml*, *setup.py*, or *setup.cfg*. If there is no metadata file, create one, as Cachi2 looks for the name and version of your project in the metadata files.

+
[source,metadata]
----
[metadata]
name = "my_package"
version = "0.1.0"
----

+
NOTE: Instead of a *pyproject.toml* file, you can also create a *setup.py* or *setup.cfg* file. For information on the metadata of these files, see link:https://github.com/containerbuildsystem/cachi2/blob/main/docs/pip.md#project-metadata[Project Metadata].

. Generate a fully resolved *requirements.txt* file that contains all the transitive dependencies and pins them to a specific version and hash by using the following command:

+
[source,command]
----
$ pip-compile pyproject.toml --generate-hashes
----

+
[NOTE]
==== 
* To successfully run the command mentioned above your environment must be as close as possible to the environment in the container build. That is, the environment should have the same operating system and the same Python $major.$minor version.

* The above-mentioned command assumes that you have defined project dependencies in *pyproject.toml*. However, if you have defined the project dependencies in either the *setup.py*, *requirements.txt*, or *requirements.in* files, ensure to update the command accordingly.
====

. Add the *requirements.txt* to the root of your componentâ€™s source code. 

. In the root of your repository create a file, *requirements-build.in*.

. Copy the build system requirements from the *pyproject.toml* file to the *requirements-build.in* file.

+
*For example:*
+
image::build-requirements.png[Build requirements, role="image"]

. Run the `pip_find_builddeps.py` script and `pip-compile` the outputs by using the following command:

+
[source,command]
----
$ pip_find_builddeps.py requirements.txt \
--append \
--only-write-on-update \
-o requirements-build.in
----

. Use the `pip-compile` command to convert the *requirements-build.in* file in to the *requirements-build.txt* file by using the following command:

+
[source,command]
----
$ pip-compile requirements-build.in --allow-unsafe --generate-hashes
----

. Add the *requirement-build.txt* file to your project. It does not require any changes to your build process. 

+
NOTE: `pip` automatically installs the build dependencies when needed for explicit installation. The purpose of the *requirement-build.txt* file is to enable Cachi2 to fetch the build dependencies and provide them to `pip` for offline installation in a network-isolated environment.

. Go to the `.tekton` directory and locate the *.yaml* files related to the *pull-request* and *push* processes.

. Configure the hermetic pipeline.

.. Add the following hermetic pipeline parameters in both the *.yaml* files:

+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    params:
        -   ...
        -   name: prefetch-input
            value: '{"type": "pip", "path": "."}' <1>
----
<1> The `prefetch-input` parameter specifies the path to the directory that has the lockfile and the package metadata files. In the above example, the `.` indicates that the package manager lock file is located in the root of the repository. Additionally, if you have multiple directories, you can provide the path to those directories in the JSON array format. For example, `[{"path": ".", "type": "pip"}, {"path": "subpath/to/the/other/directory", "type": "pip"}]`.

+
[NOTE]
====
* By default, Cachi2 processes `requirements.txt` and `requirements-build.txt` at a specified path.

* When adding the parameters mentioned above, you can safely ignore the default values for the link:https://github.com/burrsutter/partner-catalog-stage/blob/e2ebb05ba8b4e842010710898d555ed3ba687329/.tekton/partner-catalog-stage-wgxd-pull-request.yaml#L90[`pipelineSpec.params`] in the *.yaml* files.
====

.. Optional: For requirements files with non-default names and path, add the following hermetic pipeline parameters in both the *.yaml* files:

+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    params:
        -   ...
        -   name: prefetch-input
            value: '{"type": "pip", "path": ".", "requirements_files": ["requirements.txt", "requirements-extras.txt", "tests/requirements.txt"]}' <1>
----
<1> The `prefetch-input` parameter specifies the path to the directory that has the lockfile and the package metadata files. In the above example, the `.` indicates that the package manager lock file is located in the root of the repository. Additionally, if you have multiple directories, you can provide the path to those directories in the JSON array format. For example, `[{"path": ".", "type": "pip", , "requirements_files": ["requirements.txt", "requirements-extras.txt", "tests/requirements.txt"]}, {"path": "subpath/to/the/other/directory", "type": "pip", "requirements_files": ["requirements.txt", "requirements-extras.txt", "tests/requirements.txt"]}]`.

+
. Create a PR by committing your changes to the repository of the component.

. Review and merge the PR.
