= Creating secrets for your builds 

When you build your application, create secrets to ensure the `sast_synk_task` works. The `sast_synk_task` analyzes your source code to find vulnerabilities. The `sast_synk_task` secret defines parameters for your build pipeline. Add build time secrets to use in the build pipeline. These build time secrets in the build pipeline ultimately help build and deploy your application.
