== Software Bill of Materials
A software bill of materials (SBOM) provides greater transparency for your software supply chain. In {ProductName}, an SBOM is a list of all the software libraries that a xref:../glossary/index.adoc#_component[component] uses. Those libraries might enable specific functionality, facilitate development, or serve some other purpose. 

You can use an SBOM to better understand the composition of your software, identify vulnerabilities, and assess the potential impact of any security issues that might arise. You might also need to provide your customers with an SBOM to comply with cybersecurity regulations. 

== Downloading an SBOM

Currently, you must complete the last step of this process in your CLI. You need to have access to {ProductName} in your CLI, and you must install an additional CLI tool. We apologize for this inconvenience. However, using the web UI still accelerates this process.  

*Prerequisites*

* Login to the {ProductName} web UI

* Login to {ProductName} xref:../cli/getting_started_in_cli.adoc[in your CLI].

* Install the link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/[Cosign] CLI tool.

*Procedure*

Complete the following steps to download a component's SBOM:

. In the console, navigate to the *Components* tab.
+
image::sbom/components-tab.png[alt=Components tab] 

. Choose which component's SBOM you want to download. Then toggle the arrow next to that component's name to view its drop down information.

+
image::sbom/sbom-drop-down.png[alt=Component drop down information]

. Under *Download SBOM*, copy the command for downloading the SBOM.

+
image::sbom/sbom-text-to-paste.png[alt=Command to copy]

. In the CLI, paste the command and run it.

+
.Example:

+
[source]
----
$ cosign download sbom quay.io/redhat-appstudio/user-workload@sha256:<output omitted>
----

+
.. Because  the SBOM is unsigned, Cosign displays a warning about its authenticity. You can still use this SBOM for standard business processes, like providing an SBOM to your customers. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use this unsigned SBOM as a legal document.

----  
WARNING: Downloading SBOMs this way does not ensure its authenticity. 
If you want to ensure a tamper-proof SBOM, download it using 'cosign download attestation <image uri>' 
or verify its signature using 'cosign verify --key <key path> --attachment sbom <image uri>'.
----

+
.. (Optional) To view the full SBOM in a searchable format, you can redirect the output:

+
[source]
----  
$ cosign download sbom quay.io/redhat-appstudio/user-workload@sha256:<output omitted> > sbom.txt
----

== Reading the SBOM
In any SBOM, you can find the following information about each library the component uses:

. Author or publisher
. Name
. Version
. Licenses

You can use this information to verify that each library is safely sourced, updated, and compliant.
